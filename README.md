# Bookmarks.html

This project provides a single HTML file for maintaining a set of bookmarks. It is intended to make it easy for a team of developers to share bookmarks by keeping this file in a shared location (such as in a Git repository) and setting it up as their browser homepage. The advantage over other solutions such as a shared browser profile is that a HTML file can be used with any browser/OS and kept under version control.

## Getting Started

Download [`bookmarks.html`](https://github.com/hilverd/bookmarks.html/releases/latest/download/bookmarks.html) from the [latest release](https://github.com/hilverd/bookmarks.html/releases/latest) and open it in a browser.

The actual bookmarks are contained in the `pre` element near the bottom of the file.
